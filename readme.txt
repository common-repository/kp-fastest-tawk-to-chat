= Why to Use Live Chat? =

According to Neil Patel, Live Chat increases conversion rate by 45%. And we can verify this data ourselves as we use Live Chat on our own WordPress website. Customers just love it!

But Live Chat widgets are known to slow down websites. We speed up thousands of WordPress websites every month and thus we soon realized that we needed a solution to the Slow Live Chat Widgets.

= Why this plugin? =

A lot of Our customers wanted to use Tawk.to Live Chat and still wanted a very fast website. This is when our team got together one Sunday to discuss a possible solution and we found a great idea.

This plugin is a result of that idea. For more than a year, we kept this plugin within our own company and used only for our own customers. But we realized that we could help a lot more WordPress users by just realising it publicly.

And giving back to WordPress community has always been our  objective. So, here we present you our secret idea :)

If you want to use Tawk.to Live Chat and still want a very fast WordPress website, then just use this plugin.

= Features: =

* Change the Delay Time for chat to Show
* Disable Plugin for Admins & Logged in Users for Better Page Builder Experience
* Ability to Exclude Chat on Specific WordPress Pages

= How KP Fastest Tawk.to Chat compares with other chat plugins? =

Tawk.to has officially released a Chat plugin. It's great but it lacks the speed angle that we are hitting with our plugin.

You can use the Official Tawk.to chat plugin and our plugin and compare website speed using GTMetrix or Pingdom or Google Pagespeed Insights.

The speed (load time) and scores with our plugin are higher.

The great thing is that our codes can be combined and minified by Popular caching plugins like WP Fastest Cache, Autoptimze, WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache etc.
